# configurable-storms
 A mod for Stationeers that allows configuration of the in-game storms

### Features

Completed features
 - :heavy_check_mark: Enable/disable weather

### Compatibility

#### With existing saves
 - Appears safe at initial testing, but I do not guarantee safety. Make a backup

#### With other mods
 - Unsure, do not mix with weather changing mods
